# Deploying Agent Summary to Vercel

## Quick Deployment Steps

### 1. Connect to Vercel

1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and sign up/login
2. Click "New Project"
3. Import your GitHub repository: `https://github.com/eyecrackcodes/agentsummary.git`

### 2. Configure Build Settings

Vercel should automatically detect the configuration from `vercel.json`, but verify these settings:

- **Framework Preset**: Vite
- **Root Directory**: `./` (leave empty)
- **Build Command**: `cd frontend && npm run build`
- **Output Directory**: `frontend/dist`
- **Install Command**: `cd frontend && npm install`

### 3. Environment Variables

In the Vercel dashboard, add these environment variables:

- `VITE_API_BASE_URL`: Set to your backend API URL (for now, you can use a placeholder like `https://api.yourdomain.com/api`)

### 4. Deploy

Click "Deploy" and Vercel will:

- Install dependencies
- Build the React app
- Deploy to a global CDN
- Provide you with a live URL

## Features Available After Deployment

Your deployed React app will have:

‚úÖ **Advanced Analytics Dashboard**

- Interactive charts and visualizations
- Real-time filtering and sorting
- Agent performance comparisons
- Quality score analysis

‚úÖ **Data Upload & Processing**

- CSV and XLSX file support
- Real-time data validation
- Error handling and feedback

‚úÖ **Professional UI/UX**

- Material-UI components
- Responsive design
- Modern styling and animations

‚úÖ **Performance Optimizations**

- Code splitting
- Lazy loading
- Optimized bundle size

## Next Steps (Backend Integration)

To make the app fully functional, you'll need to:

1. **Deploy the Backend**: Deploy the Node.js backend to a service like:

   - Railway
   - Render
   - Heroku
   - DigitalOcean App Platform

2. **Update Environment Variables**: Once backend is deployed, update `VITE_API_BASE_URL` in Vercel with the actual backend URL

3. **CORS Configuration**: Ensure your backend allows requests from your Vercel domain
